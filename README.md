The aim of the project was to introduce topics in probability and statistics to learn Regression
which is essential from an application point of view in various industries.
The project introduces the concept and problems related to Random Walks and Markov Chains.
Following which, the topics related to Generating functions from Grimmet
and Welsh 1986 are discussed, which can be used to study generating random variables in R.
To study regression techniques, the project familiarizes the reader first with Conditional expectations
from Rohatge and Saleh 2015 and also exploring Multivariate discrete distributions,
their expectations and their Independence. The section on Probability Theory concluded with
studying Functions of Random Variables and looking in depth at the Normal Ratio distribution.
The Statistical part commences by studying Sample statistics and their distributions from
Rohatge and Saleh 2015. Following this, the project takes an in depth look at Simple Linear
Regression Models in particular the Least square method, its constructions and looking at the
estimate, confidence interval and the expectation of the slope, intercept, the prediction and
confidence interval from Sheather 2009. Following which the paper studies how to check for
Valid and Invalid Regression models using Residuals, leverage points, standard residuals and
normality of errors and constant variance. Finally the project concludes by studying in details
the logarithmic transformation and in particular the Box−Cox method.
